Welcome to Pithon!

You attend a famous duel in the city of Pithon. During the duel of a Famous Mage and the Leader of the Red Knights, they both disappear! Onlookers are shocked!

You notice a group of hooded figures depart, but you don't know where...

You also see a sad looking man head to the north.

Your friend, Criaf, heads back to the east.

Will you take up the call to become the Protector of Pithon?

To play this adventure, simply download, and run on the Python 3 IDLE.

The game is challenging, but to make it easier, you can type "help". The game is more fun without it, but it's there if you need it.

Another addition is a MAP! The Map of Pithon also simplifies gameplay.
